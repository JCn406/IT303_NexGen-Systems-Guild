PARK-TASTIC Smart Urban Parking Management System: System Architecture

The system architecture of PARK-TASTIC is designed to optimize parking management through a blend of real-time monitoring, user interface applications, and data management, facilitated by a layered infrastructure. Below, the system components and their interactions are defined to give an overview of how PARK-TASTIC operates.


1. Hardware Components

Client Devices:

Smartphones, tablets, and computers used by drivers, parking managers, and administrators.

Equipped with network connectivity (e.g., Wi-Fi, 4G/5G) to access the PARK-TASTIC application.


Edge Sensors:

IoT sensors installed in each parking spot to monitor occupancy and availability in real-time.

Types: Proximity, pressure, and optical sensors.

Connected to the network via low-energy protocols like Zigbee, Wi-Fi, or LPWAN for continuous data updates.


Local Parking Management Servers:

Servers located on-site to collect and temporarily store parking data.

Handles data aggregation, preprocessing, and communication with central cloud servers.


Central Cloud Servers:

Hosted on cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure) for scalable, high-availability services.

Stores user data, parking data, reservations, and payment history.




2. Software Applications

Mobile and Web Application (Front-End):

User Interface: React Native or Flutter for cross-platform mobile compatibility; React or Angular for web.

Functionality: Account management, parking reservations, payment processing, and real-time space availability.

Client-Side Processing: Utilizes local device resources for smooth user experiences (e.g., real-time map rendering, notifications).


Backend (Application Server):

API Service: Built with ASP.NET Core or Node.js to handle requests between client applications and database services.

Business Logic: Manages reservation handling, pricing adjustments, payment processing, and loyalty points calculations.

Authentication and Authorization: Role-based access for users, parking managers, and administrators using OAuth 2.0 or JWT tokens.


Database (Data Management Layer):

Database Management System: SQL-based system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for structured storage of user, reservation, payment, and sensor data.

Data Warehousing: Optional NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB) for storing large sets of historical data, used for analytics.

Data Caching: Redis or Memcached for caching frequently accessed data, improving response times for users.


IoT Data Management (Edge Processing):

Real-time processing and filtering of data from sensors before relaying to the central server.

Edge software manages connectivity and status updates, reducing latency in the availability data.


Analytics and Reporting Tools:

An analytics dashboard (e.g., Power BI, Tableau) for parking managers and administrators to view parking trends, occupancy rates, and revenue insights.

Predictive analytics models for dynamic pricing, demand forecasting, and space optimization.




3. Networking Components

Internet Gateway:

Facilitates secure data transfer between the local parking servers and the cloud servers, ensuring that data is encrypted using protocols like HTTPS or MQTT.


Local Network (LAN):

Connects IoT sensors to local parking servers, typically via Wi-Fi, LPWAN, or Zigbee.

Provides a high-speed network within each parking area to ensure fast updates to parking spot availability.


Cloud Network:

Connects all components across different geographic locations, supporting data synchronization, redundancy, and backup through cloud services.


Firewall and VPN:

Ensures secure communication between the client devices and backend servers, with added security for administrators via VPN.




4. System Architecture Diagram Overview

1. Client Layer (Usersâ€™ devices running mobile/web app):

Provides real-time interaction for users, parking managers, and administrators.

Connects to the backend through RESTful or GraphQL API over HTTPS.



2. Application Layer (Backend API Server):

Interprets requests from clients, processes reservations, payments, and sends parking data updates.

Manages business logic for dynamic pricing, authentication, and authorization.



3. Data Layer (Database Servers):

Stores structured and unstructured data, including user accounts, reservations, payments, and historical sensor data.

Connects with edge data management to update spot availability.



4. Edge Layer (IoT Sensors and Local Server):

Collects real-time data on parking occupancy.

Local processing minimizes latency, with periodic data synchronization to central servers.



5. Analytics and Dashboard Layer (Cloud-Based Analytics):

Offers insights and predictions through data analytics.

Allows for real-time monitoring and reporting for parking managers.





How the Components Interact

1. User Interaction:

Users interact with the system via a mobile or web app to view parking availability, make reservations, and complete payments.

These requests are sent to the backend server.



2. Backend Processing:

The backend server processes incoming user requests, fetches or updates data from the database, and returns relevant information to users.

Handles all business logic, including user authentication, spot availability checks, and reservation management.



3. Data Flow from IoT Sensors:

IoT sensors send real-time occupancy data to the local server, which updates availability.

Aggregated data is then sent to the central database for synchronization.



4. Analytics and Management:

The dashboard provides managers with insights on usage patterns, pricing recommendations, and system status.

Administrators adjust settings, pricing, and monitor performance through a secure interface.
